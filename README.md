# fair_spectral_clustering

MATLAB code for our paper "Guarantees for Spectral Clustering with Fairness Constraints" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08668).

To reproduce the experiments shown in Figures 2 to 4, simply run *experiments_Figure2_Row1.m*, *experiments_Figure2_Row2.m*, *experiments_Figure3.m* or *experiments_Figure4.m*. In the first line of the scripts, one can set the number of runs over which to average the results.

The code has been tested in MATLAB R2017b.
